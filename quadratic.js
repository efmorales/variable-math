#### `quadratic.js`

Create three variables, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Set them to any numbers you please as long as:
* a is not zero
* `b²` is greater than or equal to `4 × a × c`

Now use the quadratic formula (oh no) to calculate two value of two new variables, `x1` and `x2`.

Note: you'll need to do the formula twice. For `x1`, use a + in place of the ± symbol. For `x2`, use a -.

let a = 1
let b = 9
